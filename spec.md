# MVP Specification: Vehicle Analysis Web App
Goal: A web app that helps first-time buyers and used car shoppers analyze vehicles by comparing pricing, reliability, fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and other key metrics.

## 1. Core Features (MVP Scope)
### User Input & Preferences
- Basic Filters: Budget, vehicle type (sedan, SUV, etc.), fuel type (petrol, diesel, electric, hybrid), transmission (manual/automatic), seating capacity.

- Priority Metrics Selection: Users can rank importance (e.g., fuel efficiency > resale value > maintenance cost).

### Vehicle Comparison & Analysis
1. Key Metrics Per Vehicle:
- Pricing trends (historical & current market value)
- Fuel efficiency (city/highway MPG or kWh/100km)
- Estimated maintenance costs (annual avg.)
- Crash test ratings (e.g., Euro NCAP, NHTSA)
- Life expectancy (mileage/years before major repairs)
- Engine capacity & performance (0-60 mph, horsepower)
- Resale value depreciation (projected over 5 years)
2. Comparison Tool: Side-by-side vehicle comparisons with graphs.
3. Vehicle Report Card: Summary with scores (e.g., "Reliability: 8/10, Cost Efficiency: 7/10").

### Data Sources (MVP)
- APIs: (e.g., Edmunds, NHTSA, FuelEconomy.gov)
- Web Scraping: (e.g., used car listings for real-time pricing)
- Manual Entry: For less accessible data (e.g., local market adjustments).

## 2. Technical Stack & Architecture
### Frontend (Client-Side)
- Framework: React.js (with Next.js for SSR if needed)
- UI/Graphing: Chart.js / D3.js for data visualization
- Styling: Tailwind CSS or Material-UI

### Backend (Server-Side)
- Framework: Node.js (Express) or Python (Django/Flask)
- Database: PostgreSQL (structured data) + Firebase (if real-time updates needed)
- Data Processing: Python (Pandas, NumPy for analysis) in a separate module
- API Handling: Axios (frontend) + server-side API integrations

### Data Flow & Architecture
1. User Input → Frontend (React) → Backend (Python)
2. Backend Processing:
- Fetches data from APIs/web scraping/manual import
- Runs analysis
- Stores structured data in PostgreSQL
3. Response to User:
- Backend sends analyzed data → Frontend renders graphs/report card

### Deployment
- Hosting: Vercel (Frontend) + Heroku/AWS (Backend)
- Database: AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) or Firebase

## 3. Future Roadmap (Post-MVP)
- VIN Decoder & License Plate OCR for vehicle history checks
- AI-Powered Recommendations ("Best car for your budget & needs")
- Mobile App Version (React Native)
- Dealership/Insurance Partnerships (Monetization)
